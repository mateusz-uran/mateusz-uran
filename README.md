### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
IT engineer with specialization of web development. I'm familiar with technologies such as spring-boot for backend. At the frontend, I feel comfortable in React
but I've used also Thymeleaf at the beggining of my journey with programming. 
I'm trying to be full stack developer so MySQL or HTTP protocols are known to me.
